# RGB LED Demo

This example drives an SK68XX RGB LED that is connected to the GPIO8 pin. This RGB LED
is existing on that pin for the [ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/hw-reference/esp32c3/user-guide-devkitm-1.html) and the
[ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/hw-reference/esp32c3/user-guide-devkitc-02.html) development boards.

The demo will switch between low-brightness `red`, `green` and `blue` every second.
