# Blinky Demo

This example toggles a LED that is connected to the GPIO2
port with an frequency of 0.5 Herz (1s on, 1s off).

**This example does NOT toggle the LED that is present on
the devKit boards. That LED is RGB (SK68XXMINI-HS) and
requires a pulse-encoded drive logic (e.g. using the
RMT peripheral).**
